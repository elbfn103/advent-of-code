# advent-of-code

I created this repository to store all my solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).
You can find each year's solutions under their corresponding folder, organized by day, along with my puzzle inputs under `resources`.
Feel free to use/take inspiration/do whatever with my code for your own Christmas-y coding purposes!

Below I've listed each year with the language I used, along with some brief comments.

## 2021 - Java

My first year attempting to complete all 25 days. 
I decided to do it in Java mainly because it's by far my most used and most comfortable language. 
It'll also help me prepare for technical interviews, though the problems are less Leetcode-esque.

Seeing how it's my first year, I didn't pay too much attention to code style/beauty.
My solutions are also definitely not optimized for efficiency/space.
I still tried to abstract classes away from `Main` and use a bit of OOP, but mostly I just made sure it was functional.

Next year I'd definitely want to try another language. I'm thinking Python, Rust, or C/C++, but we'll see.
I should probably also put a little more effort into optimization and style.
